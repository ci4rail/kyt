# Go API Server for openapi

This is the KYT API Server

## Overview

(https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

- API version: 0.0.1
- Build date: 2021-01-13T15:37:23.273Z[GMT]

### Hacks necessary on generated code:

go/routers.go: Missing import "mime/multipart"
several unused imports: Run `goimports -w kyt-api-server

### Running the server
To run the server, follow these simple steps:

```
go run main.go
```

To run the server in a docker container
```
docker build --network=host -t openapi .
```

Once image is built use
```
docker run --rm -it openapi
```

### Quick test with browser
